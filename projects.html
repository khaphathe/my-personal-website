                    Created a fully functional personal portfolio website using <strong>HTML</strong>, showcasing my
                    bio, contact details, and project work.
                    The site includes three main pages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home</strong> ‚Äì Personal photo, heading, video, and bio.</li>

                <p><strong>Date:</strong> 03 April 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Continued development of my personal portfolio website by integrating external CSS to enhance
                    styling and responsiveness.
                    Focused on improving layout, design consistency, and user interaction across various devices.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>media queries</strong> to create a responsive layout
                        for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.</li>
                    <li>Styled elements with custom colors, fonts, and spacing for a clean, professional appearance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implemented <strong>hover effects</strong>, smooth scrolling, and a mobile-friendly

                <p><strong>Submission Date:</strong> 11 April 2025 ‚Äì 09:00 AM</p>
                <p>
                    This task introduced core JavaScript concepts through practical exercises, divided into three major
                    sections:
                    Variables, Data Types & Operators, and Conditional Statements & Loops. Each topic was implemented in
                    its own file
                    and pushed to a dedicated GitHub repository.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Practiced declaring, reassigning, and printing variables of
                        different types including strings, numbers, and booleans. Also explored arithmetic operations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Types & Operators:</strong> Used comparison and logical operators, experimented
                        with assignment operators, and understood the behavior of number and boolean data types.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conditional Statements & Loops:</strong> Built temperature and divisibility checks using
                        both <code>if-else</code> and <code>switch</code> statements. Loops included for, while, and
                        do-while structures for iterating through sequences and arrays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Challenges:</strong> Solved HackerRank problems (Number Line Jumps, Sales by
                        Match, and Bill Division) with attention to correctness and optimization.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This comprehensive task solidified my understanding of core JavaScript fundamentals while also
                    developing my problem-solving
                    skills through applied coding and algorithm challenges.

                <h2>üü® JavaScript Task ‚Äì 2: Memory Game</h2>
                <p><strong>Submission Date:</strong> 16 April 2025 ‚Äì 09:00 AM</p>
                <p>
                    This task involved creating an interactive memory matching game using DOM manipulation. The game
                    challenges users to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them over in a 4x4 grid layout.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Game board features 16 cards arranged in a 4x4 grid, each with a hidden letter (A-H) paired with
                        one other card.</li>
                    <li>Players click two cards to reveal letters; matched pairs stay face up while unmatched pairs flip
                        back after a short delay.</li>
                    <li>Only two cards can be flipped at once to enforce game rules.</li>
                    <li>The game concludes when all pairs are matched and revealed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This project enhanced my skills in JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and timing functions
                    to create smooth, interactive gameplay. It also emphasized careful state management to control the
                    game logic and user experience.
